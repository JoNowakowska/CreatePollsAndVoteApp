# Welcome to the Create Polls And Vote app

## About the Create Polls And Vote app
This app has a simple menu, which allows users to:
        1 - Create a new poll
        2 - List open polls
        3 - Vote on a poll
        4 - Show poll votes statistics
        5 - Select a random winner from a poll
        6 - Exit
        
The idea for the app was taken from an amazing course of Teclado, but the code was developed by me in 95%.

## Database information
This app is designed to cooperate with a PostgreSQL database. 
If you want to use this code, create a PostgreSQL database and a .env file. Paste a URL of your database to the .env file as a DATABASE_URL variable. 
You can check a .env.example file to see how your .env file should look like.

## How to prepare environment and run the Create Polls And Vote app
I used Python 3.8.1. to create this app.
Prior running the code, you need to install all the required libraries (you can find them listed in the requirements.txt file).

# How to run the app
To run the app, double click the APP.py file. The Menu should appear in your console right away. Ejnoy!

# Thanks for your time!
