# Create a poll, vote and check stats
This is a simple backend app to practice programming with Python, SQL and Postgres. The idea for the app taken from an amazing course of Teclado, but the code developed by me in 95%.

# How to run the app
To run the app you need to install psycopg2-binary and python dotenv. You also need to create .env file with a URL to your Postgres database. Then double click APP.py file and enjoy.

# Thanks for your time!
